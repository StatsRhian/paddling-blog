Chased the DFDS out between  the piers. Slight tide race off the North pier. \n\nQuite choppy and a good height (5m) for playing in rock gardens between Trow &amp; Marsden.\n \nTwo Shields youths entertained themselves by throwing rocks at us ðŸ™„\n\nMick caught us up for some rock hopping before we headed back around South pier at sunset.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell preview='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://dgtzuqphqg23d.cloudfront.net/0r78uwq7Mbby4LHXfjut1xHCuHq9CFMa_WiUBFq0lSQ-768x511.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n",
