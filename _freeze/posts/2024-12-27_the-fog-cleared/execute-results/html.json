However, by the time we were getting on the water, the fog burnt off. \n \nWe stopped for lunch at Souter point. On the paddle back a mega wave broke near the arch. \n\nWith Paul, Sarah, Dave, Gail, Tim, Tony, Mark, Pauline.\n\n\n::: {.cell preview='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://dgtzuqphqg23d.cloudfront.net/BV5rpabh4IHD0bmHfUMWz37L8sr3oNaFnMC0eqz6HZ8-768x345.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n",
