First Coquet island trip of the year. The seals came out to play and we were surrounded whilst they played with our toggles. Ann & Pauline headed back after lap one whilst Kirstie and I went around for a second time.

Afterwards we got chips at Amble and watched the eider ducks dive for their lunch. Saw some curlews and avocets in the estuary too.
