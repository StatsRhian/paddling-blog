Early morning start for a Saturday TPC improvers session. I was on the water early enough to catch the DFDS coming in, which is always exciting.

Lots of us out. Paul and Josh paddled with the improvers who had booked on the session, but there were also lots of peer paddlers out to support.

The water was very calm and clear, and I paddled over the rocks to the steps near Browns Bay.

Just as we got off the water it started chucking it down, so we piled into the rowing club to eat our chips before heading to the pool session.
