Oronsay, Wiay, Tarner and Harlosh islands.

With the wind forecast to drop during the afternoon we planned a later start to the day, meeting for noon at Portnalong Pier for a paddle around Loch Bracadale.

Paddling past Oronsay we did some rock hopping through gullies, until a big set came in and surprised three paddlers. The rock hopping was a little more  cautious after that!

Crossing to Wiay island we explored some caves, and then another short crossing took us to the southern end of Tarner Island, and a well-earned second lunch on a rocky beach with excellent views of the Cuillin Mountains to the south east. At the high water mark we found the source of the strong rotten smell that welcomed us when we first arrived, a dead rotting whale had been washed up some time ago.

Paddling up the western side of the island, we then crossed to Harlosh island, where we stopped on a white sandy beach for a nap in the sun.  Before a longer 3km crossing took us to a beach on Wiay, Camas na Cille, the best landing spot on the island. Another short break before heading to the southern end of the island where the best caves and cliffs can be found.

We paddled slowly along this end of the island, enjoying the steep cliffs and caves as much as we could. I practiced my transits a little bit on the crossings - and they worked! Trust the transit. I didn't really think about the plan or the group, just enjoyed playing around in the rocks with some encouragement from Mike Beechy. 

When we got off the water at 7pm Chris was pretty shattered so I made a pot of coffee for the two leaders. A lovely first day.
