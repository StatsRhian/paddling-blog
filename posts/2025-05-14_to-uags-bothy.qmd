Finally joined by Sue, this was day 1 of a 2 day overnight trip to the mainland at Applecross bothy. Launching from Broadford after restocking and much boat handling down a rocky shore (must be an idyllic launch at high water..) we left at 3pm in calm serene conditions. We island hopped over to the overnight stop via Guillamon, Longay and Crowlin island

One wise person set up camp in the bothy, the rest of us thought the evening breeze would keep the wee beasties in check. We watched the sun go down and had the annual LCC gymnastics competition (Mike’s headstand won, with Dans “crow” a close 2nd.) A swim was had by a few. A lovely paddle and evening.
