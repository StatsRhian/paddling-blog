The fact that Sue couldn’t join us again due to ongoing van problems was the only spoiler of this perfect day; the first trip that involved a shuttle (with many thanks to Graeme) we saw the island mist lift to reveal sunny blue skies. The get in point at Tarskavaig bay was a beautiful beach (noted as a future good camping spot) and off we paddled heading south on the west side of the Sound of Sleat. The grim name did not live up to its expectations; the range of Cuillins were behind us, the full range of highland hills were in sight and the sea was a mill pond for much of the day. “More like a mindfulness trip than a sea kayaking trip” was one comment. I practised my rock hopping as we hugged the coast. Looking where I want to go seemed to really help.

The first break was on a grassy knoll overlooking idyllic small islands. We hurried to paddle around the tip of the Sound, expecting tidal streams, but Chris had timed it perfectly and we didn’t even notice we had gone round it. We then pulled into the most beautiful beach on Skye, Camas Daraich – pure white sand and crystal-clear water, and so we all went swimming. Reluctantly we packed up but again with excellent timing as a pair of dolphins swam alongside Nic’s boat; a magical experience for all of us as we watched them swimming and playing. Onwards then to Armadale – a hard slog of wind against tide – and finally Sligachan campsite where showers and beers were much appreciated.
