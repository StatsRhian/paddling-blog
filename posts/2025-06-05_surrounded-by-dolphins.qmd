After a chaotic start (leaving my kit bucket back at home and having to drive back for it ðŸ¤¦) had a lovely, chatty paddle with Kirstie. Rain showers and rainbows.

We spotted a pod of dolphins a little way out at Marsden rock heading North. On the way back, we paddled a little further out hoping we might spot more. We were rewarded with some great sightings. A pod of about 15 - 20, with a couple of mother-calf pairs.  We watched them breaching and playing in the bow wake of the car carrier which came through at 8pm.

In my rush to photograph the breaches I accidentally threw my phone in the sea. Ooops. 

After sitting and watching the dolphins for so long, I was quite cold and tired getting off the water. I was very grateful to Heather from the rowing club for running out and helping me carry my boat up in the pouring rain. Quite the adventure for a Thursday evening.
