Standard loop around Coquet. We considered doing surf practice on the other side of the north pier but it was pretty big swell, so we left Andy and Tim to play whilst Sarah and I chatted with Kaye and watched from a safe distance.

After the paddle, I drove around to Low Hauxley and tried out my van setup, including making an egg butty on the beach.
