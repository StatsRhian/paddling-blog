Last day of the TPC club trip.  We planned to only paddle in the morning as the wind was due to pick up in the afternoon. We did a little paddle around Erraid to a huge desert-like beach. We took the outer line on the way out, playing in a little swell, and then picked through the gentle channels on the way back.
