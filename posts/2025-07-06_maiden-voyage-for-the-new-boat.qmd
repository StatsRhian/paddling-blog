My first time out in my plastic SKUK Romany Sportive - which I've christened Guto. 
The boat handled really well and I couldn't tell much difference between that and my fibreglass Romany Classic. Perhaps a little less responsive. A few people tried out the boat when we got off the water.

We paddled into the little bay by the South Jetty to support a local swimming event, trying to get the bay marked as a swim spot. I tried and failed a roll but at least that meant I got logged as both a swimmer and a kayaker!

Went for chips in amble afterwards #willpaddleforchips
