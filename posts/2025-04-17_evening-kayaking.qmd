Paddled solo from the Haven to Browns bay and then joined in with the TPC club session. 

Perfect conditons in Browns bay for getting novices comfortable in a bit of swell near rocks. Paddled through Cullercoars cave. A friendly seal came to say hello. Practiced bongo sliding in the baby surf. 
Lovely start to the long weekend.
