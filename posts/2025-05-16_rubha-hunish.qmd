Amazing rocks hopping along the cliffs,  mega caves and sea eagles.

The forecast of low wind and yet another day of blue sky and sunshine saw us leaving Sligachan early in order to paddle around the most northerly tip of Skye on our last day of paddling. This relatively exposed point is often inaccessible, but with force 1 wind forecast for much of the day, we couldn’t wait to get started. The shuttle was set up and we set off in almost flat calm sea, passing first Staffin Island, then Eilean Flodigarry. Whilst passing this second island we were treated to a sea eagle fly-by. As we approached the coast of Skye again, dramatic basalt cliffs towered high above us.

At the base of one set of cliffs a small cave entrance could be seen. Our intrepid explorer Dan led the way into and then through the cave, exiting 20m down the coast. There followed the most amazing cliff scenery including more towering columns, caves and bird life. I kept thinking "This is sea kayaking"

There was no safe landing place until we reached the bay close to Kilmaluag, where we spent a pleasant hour waiting for the tide to turn sufficiently for a little tidal assistance around and beyond the point. The perfect conditions continued around Rubha Hunish where yet more caves and rock hopping provided the challenge. Perhaps the greatest challenge was Claire’s valiant attempt to deploy her sail whilst rafted up to two others and with barely a breath of wind!

The most difficult part of the day involved landing on a slippery rock shore and carrying the gear up a steep bank and over a fence in order to reach the road. However, memories of this fantastic day will stay with us for a long time. Great weather, amazing scenery, good company and excellent leadership. Thanks to all for your part in making this day one of the best.
