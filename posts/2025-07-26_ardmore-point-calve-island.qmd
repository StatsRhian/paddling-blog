We set off from the colourful houses of Balamory / Tobermory in warm sunshine.
What was supposed to be a short 8km jaunt to the lighthouse and back ended up as a 3 hour paddle as we kept saying "let's just go around this next corner". 

We paddled across Bloody Bay (site of a sea battle in 1480) to Ardmore point (the most North Easterly point on Mull). We saw grey seals hauled out and a local fisherman diving. Our paddle back up the sound was assisted by wind and swell, and although it was sunny and clear when we set off, a squall and mist came in as we got back to Tobermory. 

Thankfully it passed quickly and we enjoyed a gentle lap of Calve island before a refreshing dunk under a waterfall. Pies from Tobermory bakery were devoured when we got off the water.
