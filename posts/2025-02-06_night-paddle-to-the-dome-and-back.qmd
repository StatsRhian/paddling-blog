Evening paddle to Spanish city and back with Paul, Sarah, Will, Gordon and Geoff.
It was cold but calm and the half moon lit the sky well enough to see without our torches. Although we did turn our lights on for the small section in the River Tyne to keep the port authority happy. 

When we got to Spanish City, myself Sarah and Paul decided to head back while the others continued on to the lighthouse. It can be really quite disorienting paddling at night. Sometimes it felt like we were travelling much faster than we actually were other times large waves would creep up on us. 
Had a hot chocolate the rowing club and then headed back home tired but very happy to have a squeezed in an excellent midweek paddle in February.
