With Josh & Kev both who had physical niggles so we took it easy. F4 gusting F6 Easterlies so we hand-railed to get shelter. I practiced some nav along the way trying to pin point where we were.

Had lunch at Cross Michael and had a chat with the fishermen. Popped into the local shop to grab a coffee and some ice cream. Helped some of the fishermen relaunch their boat before we got on and had a wind assisted paddle back up the loch.

Saw the novice group doing some skills in the wind and went for a short pootle up the river before getting off.
