Stunning views of the Cullins and a lovely swim in Loch Coruisk.

Not the smoothest start, with a broken skeg, broken tyre and broken-down van delaying our start. Preparing to launch from Elgol I bumped into Will from Tynemouth who was finishing up an epic exped, including a crossing to Lewis and back!

The title in the Doug Cooper book for this paddle is Cuillin Magic and given the weather, it was just that. We followed the east side of Loch Scavaig, past the beach where the legendary Camusunary bothy beckoned, and hauled our boats high onto the rocks at the access point for Loch Coruisk.
A short walk takes you to the loch, where drysuits were stripped off for a pre-lunch swim and a stroll and a photo-shoot amongst stunning scenery. Although it was hot in the sunshine, the downdraughts from the Cuillins were cold and strong.

A cross-wind made a slightly more challenging crossing from Soay to Elgol, with the group getting a little split up and one paddler asking for a tow for security as she struggled to control her boat in the wind. But all made it successfully back to Elgol for a peaceful hot chocolate.
