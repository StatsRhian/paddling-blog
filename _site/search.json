    "text": "Distance: 18.5 km\nStrava\n\nWe set off from the colourful houses of Balamory / Tobermory in warm sunshine. What was supposed to be a short 8km jaunt to the lighthouse and back ended up as a 3 hour paddle as we kept saying ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just go around this next corner‚Äù.\nWe paddled across Bloody Bay (site of a sea battle in 1480) to Ardmore point (the most North Easterly point on Mull). We saw grey seals hauled out and a local fisherman diving. Our paddle back up the sound was assisted by wind and swell, and although it was sunny and clear when we set off, a squall and mist came in as we got back to Tobermory.\nThankfully it passed quickly and we enjoyed a gentle lap of Calve island before a refreshing dunk under a waterfall. Pies from Tobermory bakery were devoured when we got off the water. #WillPaddleForPie"

There was quite a bit of clapotis in the Sound of Iona, but much less action off the north west corner than we were expecting.\nI practiced my nav, correctly identifying some of the smaller beaches and islands.\nWe decided to go via Eilean na Liathanaich Light. We got a lot of wind assistance by being just a little off the coast and did the 1km crossing quickly.\nPaddling across Loch na Lathaich into Bunessan the group split up a bit, with paddlers rushing to cars. Although conditions were calm, a little squall picked up with wind rushing from Loch Caol, and it got busy as a few RIBs came in quickly. Kirstie pointed out that the group dispersing that much would be a fail if I was doing my SKL assessment which was a useful reminder.\nHad a pint and chips at Bunessan whilst we waited for the shuttle."

The boat handled really well and I couldn‚Äôt tell much difference between that and my fibreglass Romany Classic. Perhaps a little less responsive. A few people tried out the boat when we got off the water.\nWe paddled into the little bay by the South Jetty to support a local swimming event, trying to get the bay marked as a swim spot.

We were woken at about 04:30 by the local cuckoo but returned to snoozing until the inevitable could be delayed no longer, and battle with the midges commenced. A rout ensued, with most party members having mislaid some piece of kit (sunglasses, sun hat, sandals) by the time we congregated out of range, 50m off shore, at about 08:45.\nWe paddled east along the south shore of the Applecross peninsular with flat water and little or no breeze for about 5km before turning south to make the 3km crossing of the mouth of Loch Carron to the beautiful NTS owned islands west of Plockton. Winding our way through the archipelago we failed to stop at an idyllic stretch of Caribbean sand on one of the islands and then spent 45 minutes looking for somewhere further on to land for lunch, eventually stopping in Erbusaig Bay.\nRefuelled and refreshed by some sunbathing we continued through the Black Islands and past Eilean Ban to dodge the sightseeing boats as we shot under the main span of the Skye Bridge (it was actually close to low tide so there was relatively little shooting but quite a lot of dodging!). The get out at Kyleakin was straightforward with plenty of parking space and proved to be a suitable location for the launch of the LCC No Shit campaign. Having posed with our poo pots, we headed back to Sligachan campsite for a trip the bar and then the shower."

    "text": "Distance: 23.2 km\nStrava\n\nThe fact that Sue couldn‚Äôt join us again due to ongoing van problems was the only spoiler of this perfect day; the first trip that involved a shuttle (with many thanks to Graeme) we saw the island mist lift to reveal sunny blue skies. The get in point at Tarskavaig bay was a beautiful beach (noted as a future good camping spot) and off we paddled heading south on the west side of the Sound of Sleat. The grim name did not live up to its expectations; the range of Cuillins were behind us, the full range of highland hills were in sight and the sea was a mill pond for much of the day. ‚ÄúMore like a mindfulness trip than a sea kayaking trip‚Äù was one comment. I practised my rock hopping as we hugged the coast. Looking where I want to go seemed to really help.\nThe first break was on a grassy knoll overlooking idyllic small islands. We hurried to paddle around the tip of the Sound, expecting tidal streams, but Chris had timed it perfectly and we didn‚Äôt even notice we had gone round it. We then pulled into the most beautiful beach on Skye, Camas Daraich ‚Äì pure white sand and crystal-clear water, and so we all went swimming. Reluctantly we packed up but again with excellent timing as a pair of dolphins swam alongside Nic‚Äôs boat; a magical experience for all of us as we watched them swimming and playing. Onwards then to Armadale ‚Äì a hard slog of wind against tide ‚Äì and finally Sligachan campsite where showers and beers were much appreciated."

The rock hopping was a little more cautious after that!\nCrossing to Wiay island we explored some caves, and then another short crossing took us to the southern end of Tarner Island, and a well-earned second lunch on a rocky beach with excellent views of the Cuillin Mountains to the south east. At the high water mark we found the source of the strong rotten smell that welcomed us when we first arrived, a dead rotting whale had been washed up some time ago.\nPaddling up the western side of the island, we then crossed to Harlosh island, where we stopped on a white sandy beach for a nap in the sun. Before a longer 3km crossing took us to a beach on Wiay, Camas na Cille, the best landing spot on the island. Another short break before heading to the southern end of the island where the best caves and cliffs can be found.\nWe paddled slowly along this end of the island, enjoying the steep cliffs and caves as much as we could. I practiced my transits a little bit on the crossings - and they worked! Trust the transit. I didn‚Äôt really think about the plan or the group, just enjoyed playing around in the rocks with some encouragement from Mike Beechy.\nWhen we got off the water at 7pm Chris was pretty shattered so I made a pot of coffee for the two leaders. A lovely first day."

We followed the east side of Loch Scavaig, past the beach where the legendary Camusunary bothy beckoned, and hauled our boats high onto the rocks at the access point for Loch Coruisk. A short walk takes you to the loch, where drysuits were stripped off for a pre-lunch swim and a stroll and a photo-shoot amongst stunning scenery. Although it was hot in the sunshine, the downdraughts from the Cuillins were cold and strong.\nA cross-wind made a slightly more challenging crossing from Soay to Elgol, with the group getting a little split up and one paddler asking for a tow for security as she struggled to control her boat in the wind. But all made it successfully back to Elgol for a peaceful hot chocolate."

    "text": "Distance: 22.2 km\nStrava\n\nAmazing rocks hopping along the cliffs, mega caves and sea eagles.\nThe forecast of low wind and yet another day of blue sky and sunshine saw us leaving Sligachan early in order to paddle around the most northerly tip of Skye on our last day of paddling. This relatively exposed point is often inaccessible, but with force 1 wind forecast for much of the day, we couldn‚Äôt wait to get started. The shuttle was set up and we set off in almost flat calm sea, passing first Staffin Island, then Eilean Flodigarry. Whilst passing this second island we were treated to a sea eagle fly-by. As we approached the coast of Skye again, dramatic basalt cliffs towered high above us.\nAt the base of one set of cliffs a small cave entrance could be seen. Our intrepid explorer Dan led the way into and then through the cave, exiting 20m down the coast. There followed the most amazing cliff scenery including more towering columns, caves and bird life. I kept thinking ‚ÄúThis is sea kayaking‚Äù\nThere was no safe landing place until we reached the bay close to Kilmaluag, where we spent a pleasant hour waiting for the tide to turn sufficiently for a little tidal assistance around and beyond the point. The perfect conditions continued around Rubha Hunish where yet more caves and rock hopping provided the challenge. Perhaps the greatest challenge was Claire‚Äôs valiant attempt to deploy her sail whilst rafted up to two others and with barely a breath of wind!\nThe most difficult part of the day involved landing on a slippery rock shore and carrying the gear up a steep bank and over a fence in order to reach the road. However, memories of this fantastic day will stay with us for a long time. Great weather, amazing scenery, good company and excellent leadership. Thanks to all for your part in making this day one of the best."

We watched them breaching and playing in the bow wake of the car carrier which came through at 8pm.\nIn my rush to photograph the breaches I accidentally threw my phone in the sea.
