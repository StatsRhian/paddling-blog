I was helping as an assistant leader with Mike Sunderland taking two family groups out around Piel.\nWe got on the water at 10:30 from the Boat Club. We did some skills in the channel, feeling the effect of the current and practising turns around the buoys. We paddled under the RNLI Lifeboat station, and paddled along though the boats before crossing to Piel island. We had lunch by the castle, and then crossed over to Walney. We tried to practice bow rudders, but the seals had other plans! They were very inquisitive and kept popping up behind us. We went around to the southern tip of Walney to the seal colony, keeping our distance. We paddled back to Roa Island, crossing the shipping channel. The sun came out in time for drinks at the RIBC bar.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, the weather was overcast, and the winds were higher, meaning we had less shelter to practice skills. After getting the paddlers in our group to switch boats, we paddled across directly to Piel castle. As the youngest paddler was getting tired, we headed back directly to Roa Island.\nI really enjoyed the opportunity to assist leading a group over two days. On the first day I was enjoying helping Annika with her handling skills. It was interesting to see how giving her a better set of paddles helped her paddling. On the second day I spent more time with her younger brother Henry, trying to keep him motivated when he got tired.\n\n\n\n",

Having a base at the bunkhouse on Muck was excellent - it gave us the opportunity to really get to know the coast of the island under different conditions and enjoy the hospitality of the local community. One of the satisfying things about having a development week was seeing the improvements across the group in the week. Swell that felt lumpy to paddle on day one became a spot for practising rolls and rescues, rock hopping gaps which felt a tight squeeze seemed to get bigger through the week and anxieties of open water crossings transformed into a quiet confidence. Personal highlights for me were our camping spot on the Isle of Eigg circumnavigation, watching a pair of Scottish eagles play in the wind and taking the local kids of Muck out for an evening paddle. A massive thanks to Mike, Mac, Mike and Marie for their coaching and support and all the other paddlers for their lovely company! Photos: https://photos.app.goo.gl/GfPnkH3AVtdowE5g6\n\n\n\n",

We were hoping to make it out to the Farne Isles, but the weather was not looking promising.\nOn Saturday, we paddled from Seahouses and headed down the coast South towards Beadnell Bay. After lunch on the bay, we headed towards Football Hole before turning back North. We stopped at Beadnell Bay again for hot drink, but paddling through the surf I had a swim.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, we attempted the crossing to the Farnes. It was very misty and there were tourist boats out so we radioed the harbour master to let them know about our crossing. It was fairly choppy on the paddle over and we were paddling on a bearing. It was a relief to see the Inner Farnes appear out from the mist. Paddling around the Farnes, we were able to get pretty close up to the cormorants and puffins. We didn’t stay too long as the weather was due to change for the worse in the afternoon. The paddle back to the mainland was much quicker, due to the tides and a following wind. Again it was really misty and it was quite spooky to suddenly hear voices and see the beach emerge from the mist. We had a damp lunch on Bamburgh Bay, although it was so misty we couldn’t see the castle! Before getting off the water at Seahouses, we practiced playing the surf and bongo sliding.\n\n\n\n",

We were on the water for around 4 hours, working toward the white water award. The group doing the WWA were myself, Arne, Paul Jackson, Simon Murby and Adam, led by Paul Simpson & Dave Horn. This time we focused less on group skills and features and more on skills. We spent lots of time ferry gliding (forwards and backwards) and practising braces.\n\n\n\nI had one swim coming past the final baffle, I tried to high brace on a wave, missed and capsized. Not the best swim as I hit myself in the face with the paddle giving my self a nose bleed and got jammed on the shallow slabs by my boat and had to let it go down river. In hindsight I could have probably pushed myself back upright off the bottom and saved myself a swim. Aside from that it was a great day, with 2 other LDCC groups out.\nA good reminder that I definitely need more low and high brace practice - something for Thursday nights on the flat water.\n\n\n\n",

Both Molly and Alis paddled really well and we got down some bouncy stuff. Gibbi must have had extra weetabix for breakfast because we were all knackered at the end of the session.

We spun out and eddied out a little lower than planned. Colin took a swim. We then tried to ferry out to the middle to run the two main groynes. This time I had a swim, getting out at the big eddy before the first groyne. Ian rescued me and later led me through the rapids. After lunch we had a second run. Colin and Ian had called it a day so this felt more like a peer paddle, choosing the lines ourselves. However, we had Rowan around to observe incase anything went wrong. Another great Saturday out - and I need to work on my edge!\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nStrava\n\n\n\nSomething for everyone today at Halton lower weir, Saturday 24th October. The forecast looked grim on paper but we seemed sheltered from the wind and except for one very heavy shower it wasn’t too bad at all. There was the usual efficient getaway to Halton. Busy for parking again. 2 ladies made it know to me that they found it difficult to park to walk their dog. The University Rowing Club were also present and this made it congested on their slipway.Amazing how long their craft are. It was a good chance for a bit of PR with them firstly over the trailer in the car park and then over possible parking down the back of the station. The former will be moved when they can get a vehicle to do it and the latter parking will not be possible because access it via an area they will be using to prepare craft for launch. Also looked at other launch/egress points away from their slipway for future days. 4 groups then below the weir for a warm-up and skills session before one group headed off towards the rapids until virtually all were up there in and around the cyclepath side of the islands making the best use of what was available. Great to see how people have come on over the last 5 weeks and lots of paddling against the current has made them stronger. It had been decided to just have one longer session. Groups slowly made their way back downstream to exit river left on the weir baffle. We certainly got in a good 2 plus hours of paddling in and everyone seemed well satisfied. We are likely to move the event to Sunday 1st November to make use of the whole river, as the fishing season ends, UNLESS the river level for that day is predicted to be way too high compared to the Saturday. We will approach the rapids from the lower weir. After that we will re-assess all our options. As mentioned in a previous post competent members can go and paddle the rapids in their own time from 1st November and approach from the Halton Mills site. I will post the Covid guidelines in the next couple of days. Members who have not been out with us recently and would like coach support should post their request later in the week. Another group of paddlers who arrived at the rapids today were amazed when I told them we were all from one Club…..LDCC. Long may we continue this level of support! Thanks to the lead figures today and of course Darren with van making kayak transport so much easier. Gibbi\n\n\n\n",

Much lower water level therefore we could get closer to the weir. Basic skills,river techniques a chance to go up towards the rapids and to run the weir. Much variety punctuated by a short lunch stop,a couple of soakings but a happy bunch were clear of the hut by 2.40pm and it had all gone rather well. Transport unshared and 2 daughters of non-paddling mums dropped at and picked up from the venue. Also could to see multi-activity use of the site what with the Fire Brigade practising rescue skills and 6 female paddle boarders/open water swimmers. Fishermen not to be seen🙂 Same time and place next week with some rain to come this week.\n\n\n\n",

It took an hour of so to load the boats up as it was our first time kayak camping and people had brought lots of stuff! There was a stong westerly wind, so we paddled west into the wind first, before turning around and making the most of the following sea. We stopped at Mossyard beach for a quick lunch, before turning into Fleet bay. We crossed the bay at a narrow point, and then followed the coast heading towards the island. It got quite choppy with big swell, which I enjoyed, however Elspeth was quite scared and was shouting swears as apparently she gets angry when she gets scared! We landed on the island, unpacked and started setting up camp. I went for a walk whilst the boys catch some fish. We had a bonfire on the beach, cooking sea bass on the fire, mussels, stick bread and apple crumble parcels (complete with forged blackberries!) A fantastic evening, and an incredible dark sky.\n\n\n\nWe packed up quickly the next morning and were on the water for 09:30. WIth the sun shining we were warm in our kayaking gear, but rounding the island the cold wind was biting. We circumnavigated the Barlocco isle, rock hopping and spotting a seal. The crossing from Barlocco to Ardwall was choppy with white horses and strong winds. From Ardwall, we crossed to the mainland, and then headed directly across the bay to Mossyard. We stopped for lunch, and Gina had a little nap as she was suffereing from the night before. Alan and I headed off direct to Auchenlarie, whilst the rest of the group played in the rocks on the final strech. A fabulous weekend and new friends made.\n\n\n\n",

People arrived well spaced to get gear and it was mostly quickly loaded in Darren’s van. Meant lots of cars headed for the old station car park but all managed to park,get their kit on,unload boats and get them down onto the big ramp in their 3 groups of 6. One group started on the flat water while the other 2 made their way onto the moving water below the weir. Had to keep well away from the weir as it was higher than the time before but plenty to play on. The slightly more experienced eventually looked after themselves,Amy and Eva joined Gibbi for their first taste of moving water and Eva proved to be AM-AZ-ING. Quick get-together at 12.15 and decision made to continue for another 45 mins or so Paul carried on with Kerry and Ruby who were finishing their beginners course (and it seems very much enjoyed their session),Colin and Anna took their group up to the bottom end of Halton Rapids (no fishermen). Some capsises but simply dealt with. Off the water and it went like clockwork to get back to the hut and put all gear away. Keep an eye on here for details of the next event. Note there are probably 5 people already on the list for that. Also there was some confusion finding the latest Thurs ev post on the LDCC page and I hope we can get that sorted. Always scroll the page to find very latest and then only reply to that one and do even look for updates at breakfast the day of paddling!\n\n\n\n",

We practised paddling out to South Head, into the winds, then looping back on ourselves. After a couple of loops, we turned south and paddled with a following sea. The paddle back up North into the wind was very hard. Eventually, we made it back to the slipway, and did a surf landing. Most of the group decided they had had enough for one day, and had a leisurely lunch. I had a lovely evening with Nic & Steve at their campervan.\n\n\n\nThankfully, the wind was lighter on Sunday, and we headed North. We stopped at Fleswick Bay for a coffee & snack. I saw a seal (possibly the Fleswick bay seal). We started heading towards Whitehaven but some of the group were struggling with the speed, so we stopped for lunch on the rocks at Saltom Bay. We slowly and gently paddled back to St Bees slipway, and popped to Hartley’s for tea.\n\n\n\n",

I passed a small group attempting to paddle the gap between Lingy Holm. Past Silver bay, and then a long strech along Birk Fell, which I used to practice efficient, fast forward paddling. I stopped for lunch near Howtown, after doing a bit of litter picking. On the paddle back south, I stopped at Norfolk Island for a hot drink and to look at the view. The southerly wind had picked up a little, making progress a little slower. I did two loops through Lingy Holm gap, and looped around Wall Holm before landing back near the ferry pier.

We paddled up to the lower weir at Halton, Gibbi telling us about the Lune as we paddles. At Halton, we played in the tongue of water coming off the weir, practicing ferry gliding. We ate lunch on the battlement, and used the portage as an excuse to run down the middle of the weir. I forgot to smile - very dangerous. After lunch we kept playing in the flow, doing S-turns and ferries. Paul cycled up to have a chat. We paddled back down to the clubhouse, using our paddles as sails and making the most of the northerly winds. Gibbi: Colin and myself combined our groups into a six with Michelle, Alice, Richard and Rhi. A fine, warm day with a breeze blowing downstream and therefore into our faces as we casually paddled up to the lower weir at Halton. A short play in the moving water before taking lunch on the baffle. Sliding into the water upstream of the weir and paddling down through the tongue was achieved without incident followed by an hour of gentle skills practice in the moving water as can be seen in the pics. Well done all. Colin and I were quite impressed with your enthusiasm and progress. With the wind behind us it was a tiring paddle back to the hut. All now wearing spraydecks confidently after passing capsize tests. Another group with Paul, 3 youngsters and Wendy did the same trip\n\n\n\n",

Pushing at the front seemed to work best. We did some skills on the paddle to the North Head including turning, towing and forward paddling. We then turned around and paddled with a following sea towards Fleswick Bay. Before stopping for lunch we practiced eskimo and X rescues. After lunch we had a leisurely paddle alongside the South head, spotting lots of cormorants and porpoises. Before landing at St Bees, we did a couple more X rescues, including a real one when I lost my balance.

The other larger group of paddlers get on was a few more miles upstream, their report to follow i’m sure. The river was on a half way up a mid. No chance for a warm we set off into swift moving water. We worked as 2 pairs and got loads of breaking out/in practice. Still plenty of large enough eddies for the 4 of us . The higher level meant very few stones to impede our progress. It was good to see our 1st year paddlers getting stuck into consolidating their skills and gaining much more benefit than another Halton rapid session. Not wanting to spoil the day we got off before the Wennigton Bridge surf wave. The swift water meant we were off, dressed, shuttle done, quite quickly so we called in at the Tatham Bridge imbibing emporium . Highly recommended. Thanks for a great day gang.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We got in below the grade 4 at Tebay (maybe next year… 😉) and warmed up with some ferry gliding. The river was on a low so the day was spent playing follow my leader and avoid the rock. I thought my river reading was improving a little until I planted myself on a rock and took a swim. Nature highlights included one lone black sheep and a pair of dippers playing. A little chilly but fulfilled we got out at Lowgill and stopped off to warm up at Longlands, Tewitfield. A lovely day to be out on the water, thanks all.\n\n\n\n",

Rhi and Paul went to train at Halton rapids which was on high end of a Low. Despite the forecast for strong winds and rain we were lucky to get 2 runs down with only an occasional gust and a bit of drizzle at the end. Apart from a couple of lady paddlers from the Ribble club, we had the river to ourselves. Pushing our techniques on the usual manoevers and throwing in a little boofing practice as well. We worked till tired, which coincided with a downturn in the weather. Time for home, Tired and satisfied.\n\n\n\n",

After some considerable parking faff (and an excellent exhibition of how to reverse a van back along a country lane by Simon) we put on at Rydal water. The river was on a low but there were plenty of eddys for people to make the river as simple or challenging as they wished and some great opportunities to practice ferry glides. A Weir provided a great (but slightly grabby) surfing spot for people to try the skills and Gibbi to take some photos of the action.\n\n\n\nThe next wave we came across offered more fun…until King of the Wave ended in both Steve and Simon high bracing for survival as they were washed off the wave. Steve was successful in saving himself from a capsize whereas Simon wasn’t. He quickly rolled in the chilly water and then had a mini sulk that he’d gotten his hair wet. Joe successfully hand paddled onto the wave and styled it for a few minutes until his hands became too cold! We finished the journey at the Rugby Club in Ambleside. Alan provided us with some much appreciated and very festive Christmas Cake whilst we checked on River levels to see if a cheeky run of the Brathay was possible. After deciding it was a smidge too low, we finished the day in Hawkshead Brewery (much to many people’s delight!) A successful day with no swims and great company. Merry Christmas and hopefully see everyone out next week🎄🥂\n\n\n\n",

A good paddle was needed and we got 1. Lots of water about, but given the crew, strong winds and poor light levels we opted for the River Kent from Burnside through Kendal to Scroggs Weir. It was on the low end of a mid level. Paddlers:- Paul, Dave, Simon, Darren, Rhi, Paul, special guest appearance from Alex Hill. And an eventual appearance of Alan and Steve. (I think they have problems with Dysania). After the shuttle, we all worked on our efficient ferry gliding skills, forwards and in reverse. The overcast but dry and calm start made progress easy as we worked on grabbing eddies, playing follow my leader.\n\n\n\nPaul over-egged a breakout, propping myself upright with paddle, but got a kindly nudge from Alex to get me level again. A sheep trapped on the riverbank was not for being helped. We pressed on to the big weir in Kendal which was well covered by Simon and Alex on the side. Everybody got over fine. Lots of surfing to be had on the town features. People dialled into their own level of fun, sometimes with persuasion. Just a couple of swims today, each as a result of side surfing. The wind picked up and was cutting. Whilst getting changed there was a good flurry of ice crystal precipitation, (not to be confused with hail, a summer phenomenae, thanks Dave for the clarification). Thank you to the cake produced by Alan or Steve to liven up the change into dry gear. Thank you everyone for another good spirited club outing.\nI had one swim after accidentally side surfing, whilst paddling through the middle of Kendal. I got pretty cold on the last section paddling to Scroggs Weir.\n\n\n\n",

Well certainly not in some areas at the moment. Turns out they have had an arrangement with the hydro people for over a year and have the code for the gate!! Lunch taken in the warmth of the changing area with some lovely cake from Alan. Always worth paddling with him. Then a further 90 mins session.

We caught up with the others at the Cafe Ambio car park. Turns out whilst we’d been working hard, they’d been having a leisurely cuppa!

By late evening fortunately most had managed the tricky navigation there and dug into Anna’s pre-prepared chilli meal. After helpings of Paul’s porridge groups broke off to paddle the Tryweryn; walk along the river via Swallow Falls; stroll in Betws and partake of food; the largest group, to MTN bike in the forest with a mix of itineraries to suit all levels, some hiring bikes/first timers/an e-bike and of course the experts. Back to BYG for a brew and shower and a meal in the pub in village.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, after cleaning the Centre, a small group on the Dee at Llangollen, but main group on a very pleasant paddle from near Betws to Llanrwst on the Conwy meeting up with locally residing Annette. Also, a couple of strollers. Then it was home. So, there was something for everyone to do . Fine accommodation, pretty good weather and great company. Thanks to Dave Horn for organising it all. Many have already expressed their gratitude elsewhere and told of their enjoyment of the weekend.\n\n\n\n",

Parking up at the old railway station, everyone geared up and braced themselves for a good 10min trek carrying the kayaks to the top of the wier along the cycle track, where we would begin our fun. Following David horns lead with help from Paul, Alec and Joe the beginners took to the water consisting of myself, Darren, kamikaze Gregg, Rhian, Kim, Mandy and steve (sorry if I’ve missed anyone). The first task was to see how far up we could paddle up a fast flowing section of water, Alec demonstrating how it was done comfortably. Everyone got stuck in with steve winning this particular challenge but everyone looked more confident with every attempt. We then headed down stream, occasionally getting stuck on the odd rock as the water levels were low. We practised picking a line through the Rapids and eddying out, everyone managing to do this well until on one section the water tipped my kayak. No problem though as I completed my first ever roll (ok I may of cheated and used an underwater rock to flip me back round but I’m claiming it). The water started to become a little more stronger which certainly got my adrenaline going along with my enjoyment. It was then on the next eddy where I think I was a little too eager to break out and ended up going for the only swim of the day, this is where the pool sessions came in handy and I calmly got to safety and reset myself for the next section. Further down we practiced ferry gliding/riding a wave. Something I’m certainly becoming more confident in doing after having a couple of opportunities to practise in the past. Darren was certainly enjoying his improvements and added confidence; every time returning with a gleeming smile. We then finished the day off by paddling down the middle of the lower wier and paddling across the strong flow a few times. It was a nice hot sunny day, enjoyed by all. Now time for a rest and a deserved beer or two, fingers cross for a week of rain.\n\n\n\n",

We met at the hut at 9am sharp as per instructions given at the talk on Thursday evening. A select band including Rhian, Lucas, Darren, Steve, Joe, Rowan, Ruby and I, ably led by Paul. Some of us not knowing quite what to expect from the winter paddling season save from it’s better than staying in and watching Coronation street and that at some stage it’s going to get proper cold. But not today though, the weather was settled as the remanents of hurricane Dorian had moved away to the north to be replaced by high pressure and settled conditions. Dorain had not filled up the rivers much though. With the water levels on the high side of low Paul suggested our options were limited to coming down the Lune on the incoming tide or playing at Halton. We decided on the later and to warm we up we would paddle there from the hut up to Halton weir. We set off upstream towards Halton just before 10am pushed along by a pleasing tail wind. We hugged river left dodging the many scullers on the river that morning. At the weir Paul tasked us with ferry gliding across the moving water from one bank to the next, only to abandon this plan when we beached in the middle of the river, the river having inconsiderately deposited a load of stones and rocks right in our path over recent weeks. Plan B was to hop over the weir and to paddle a little further upstream to practice moving water skills at the bottom of Halton rapids. At the bottom of the rapids and watched over by a sinister looking stuffed badger we got to grips with ferry gliding across the flow, breaking in and out, spotting Eddys and holding position in the flow before moving a little further up the river to fine tune on faster moving water. Steve showed us the hidden dangers of surfing when he was unexpectedly turned over by a submerged rock only to roll up in impressive fashion. Joe and Rowan demonstrated what can be achieved in a year of paddling with their stylish play boating skills. Rhian, Lucas, Darren, Ruby and I grew in confidence as the day wore on. There was only one swimmer on the day and in my defence I went over on purpose to a) test my dry suit out and b) to show Ruby how to come out of your boat in moving water and not because c) I forgot to the mantra “paddle, paddle, paddle” at a crucial moment. We paddled home about 3 but not before Paul showed us how to hug some rocks. The pleasing tail wind was now a less than pleasing head wind but the scullers had gone home at least. The head wind made the trip back a challenge to tired muscles but the sunlight playing on the water lifted the spirits. What a great day! I can think of few better ways to spend a Saturday. Thanks to Paul for his tutelage and to Rhian, Darren, Rowan, Joe, Lucas, Steve and Ruby for great company. I learnt loads not least that the best place to play a didgeridoo is under the motorway bridge! Looking forward to the next trip.\n\n\n\n",

Dave took me, Mandy, Steve, Alan and some of the ninja’s to run the Wenning, whilst the others paddled the canal. It was quick, with lots of trees to avoid and small eddys to hit. Managed the wave at Wennington bridge before falling out and having a swim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
