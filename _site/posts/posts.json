Plenty to play on around the islands, with ferry gliding and eddying out.\nI just really enjoyed being out and choosing my own bits of river to play on. I also got some towing practice in, when a Swiftwater Rescue attendee missed his throw line.\n\n\n\n\nParticipants: Alan, Arne, Chris N, Darren, Dean, Joshua, Paul B, Paul S, Rhi, Steve, Thomas. With only 1 boat to collect from the hut we were soon away and getting togged up at Halton Mills. Paul S. led the group from a mid-way baffle down to play around the islands, where we worked on our ferry gliding, surfing etc. After Paul S. had explained some of the secrets of hydrodynamics, we shot the big baffle. At noon we all got off, some had other commitments, the remainder had a quick lunch/pitstop. The 2nd run was from the top of the rapids. As we worked our way down, we had the river all to ourselves till we spied the Fireman/Rescue setting up for swim training. Despite 2 throwlines deployed to a swimming fireman, both missed and our intrepid Rhi sprang into action to toe back their bobbing swimmer. Good efforts from everyone today, especially the youth section and our 1st season paddlers. No swimmers from us is also a good result. Paul Britton\n\n\n\n\n",

There is a weird tranquillity of paddling nestled in the valley of Tebay. It’s easy to forget that you’re paddling alongside the M6.\nI’ve paddled this twice before, and it was confidence building to come back and feel comfortable enough to play and feel a little independent from the coaches. Andrew has a couple of swims, and I mostly stayed out of the way, wanted to keep myself out of trouble and not make the situation any worst. One swim, he lost his paddle and it drifted near me, so I paddled over to pick it up. However, once I picked it up - I realised I had no way of paddling whilst carrying it. Instead of doing something sensible like throwing it into an eddy, or paddling with two at once, I struggled holding both, whilst drifting, backwards, down the rapids. Not my most sensible moment. I did get stuck on a rock, but managed to pause and right myself before paddling into an eddy. Luckily Joe had run down the bank with me and was able to walk Andy’s paddle back up stream to him.\nDefinitely need some more rescue practice on moving water!\n\n\n\n\nAucht aye the noo! Just kidding. PADDLE REPORT 5/12/21 - Upper (Upper) Lune Small group today: Gibbi, Paul B, Paul J, Dale, Darren, Joe, Steve-o, Rhi, Simon & me. After dropping off all the boats and vehicles for the shuttle, most of us put in at the bottom of the rapids, but the more daring of the group decided to put in at the top and midway up the rapids. Conditions were cold but stayed dry all day (apart from the swimmer).. Gibbi started off taking me under his wing for some skill work, then we moved further down the river until I decided it was a nice morning for a swim (or three) . Quickly rescued by the gang and all made sure I was fine each time. Overall it was a very good day for it. Huge thanks to Gibbi, Paul & Simon for the coaching. Andrew Irvine\n\n\n\n\n",

The playground at Halton is such a comfort for me. We’re really lucky to have it so close. I do wonder if I should push myself to do the river trips more - but today was a day for playing it safe.\nI spent the morning with Dave, Emma and Jenny working on ferry gliding and breaking in and out below the islands. It was useful to observe Dave and get a feel for what challenges he was setting them. I chose lines which were maybe a little challenging initially so useful to remind me to set suitable goals. I paddled up to the islands to chat with Ribble and have a little play in the bigger flow. After lunch, I paddled with Emma & Jenny, this time supervised by Gibbi. We let Jenny & Emma choose routes joining up eddies and then practising some S-turns. Again I had a little play just above the islands, Dave even persuaded me to do a teeeny bit of surfing.\nI do enjoy being in the beginner groups and observing the coaching, but perhaps at somepoint I’ll need to push myself to develop further.\n\n\n\n\n14/11/21 - Paddle Report In attendance: Steve-OooO, Dave-OooO, Jenny-OoOo, Emma-OooO, Gibbi-OooO, Dale-OooO, Adam-oooO, Benji-OoOo, Rhi-OoooO (sorry-OoooOo if I forgot anyone). Halton Rapids at a 0.86(ish). Many worked on skills breaking in and out. Topside surfing, side surfing and some upside down surfing to be seen. Breaking in and out also took place. Real effort put in by lots of the paddlers today glad of the Travel to Paddle. Even saw Nathan Andrews and Alec Feuillade which was a delight. David Horn gave a lesson on dry suit repair which was graciously accepted by some members. I’m shattered! Have an ace week. Your boiiii, $t333√°0o\n\n\n\n\n",

Might be worth considering a slightly smaller boat at some point?\n\nWell what a great weekend of paddling, 6/7th November on Halton rapids. The storms of Saturday put few people off and it was encouraging to see people coming on strongly. A very pleasant river level. How things changed overnight……the river was high Sunday morning so we delayed the start until 12. Still a big flow but wow, how well did people take to it.

We decided on the Wenning which was due to be on a scrape (0.6m). However, it was actually more like the high end of a medium (0.9m - 1m). I was a little nervous, particularly about the get on which seems to be rushing through with few eddies. However, once I was on the water I felt pretty steady and confident. We skipped the big wave at the bottom - sneaking through the right hand arch which for once had some water flowing through it. A good confidence-building day for my first day back on the river.\n\n\n\n\nWe started the fantastic day at 9am at the hut (after all it was a GOOD morning). It was decided that, given the river levels, we would go to run the Wenning. Gibbi, Paul B, Paul J, Mark W, Darren, Rhi, Rachael, Dave H, Alec, Steve-O and myself made our way up and put in at the Punch Bowl at Low Bentham. Cars were quickly shuttled down to the take-out at the bridge in Wennington (Wennington Wave). As the Wenning was moving fast it was a matter of getting on the water and straight into the current. We then made our way down the bouncy river braking in and out of eddies enjoying the sun and enduring the downpours. After an absolutely fantastic paddle we reached the bridge in Wennington where a huge wave had formed since we had a look at it in the morning. Some paddled right through the huge wave to find a hole on the other side getting nice and wet, and Steve-O surfed and surfed (and he might still be surfing there, who knows?). After all this excitement Dave H, Alec, Mark, Rachael and Steve-O were stoked and decided to run the Ingleton Greta. The rest of us made our way back home in glorious weather - what a great day!\n\nArne Gerber\n\n\n\n",

Paul took the front of the group and I was to bring up the rear. When we reached the weir, we had to decide if it was possible to take the group below the weir. We had a discussion with Mark W & Rich, and decided it was feasible to climb out of boats and carry down. Although it was a little bit of a faff, it gave us access to a venue with a little moving water. Perhaps we should have communicated the plan with the group more clearly.\nI was worried that I sometimes across as “strict teacher”. E.g telling Michelle and Dale “you can’t go there”, “get in that eddy”. I think that comes from me being fearful and not knowing “what is safe”\nKeeping an eye on everyone at once was challenging. I found that sitting down river enabled me to keep most paddlers in frame, and be ready to pick anyone up if they dropped down-river.\nI spent some 1:1 time with Eva. She started off quite tired so I chatted with her and encouraged her to practice some surfing. Lending her my paddle helped with her tiredness. When we wanted a rest, we watched other paddlers try the leap frogging and reviewed their progress together. We also broke up the journey back looked for things on the journey (like the snail).\n\n\n\n\nToday’s paddle was (as always) AMAZING! We started off at Fell Foot and paddled down the River Leven until Newby Bridge. When we got there, we: surfed on a big wave, broke in and broke out and we played leep-frog going behind rocks. On the way back, I picked up a hitchhiker (a small snail) and I named him David Attenborough. We travelled back to the car, nobody worry, David was dropped off on a nice rock next to the lake. After, I practiced some rescues with Rhi’s boat, don’t panic she wasn’t in it, it was empty, and it was really fun and it helped me alot There was a nice mix of flat and moving water and it was good for the people not so confident on the white water…yeah… really smashing day!

I felt a little nervous when paddling out in the swell, but actually when surfing back through it, it wasn’t bad at all!\n\n\n\n\nWednesday 13th October – a grey windy day in Workington, not exactly the huarache sandals and baggies beach scene, but surf there was, so surfin we went. The original plan was for a group paddle from Workington to Maryport, though of the original signed-up group, only three of us made the venue (Mike Sunderland, Rhi Davies and me, John Soady). Might have been a bit of competition with a LCC beginner river white water event on the same day. Anyway, after a couple of km paddling along the coast with beam-on surf we agreed this wasn’t fun, so playing in it rather than fighting it seemed the thing to do. There was a westerly 4 pushing a 2ft swell, which kicked up to about 3ft of breaking surf over the sand bars where the Derwent meets the sea. It was fun for an hour or so until the arm muscles started to complain. Mike and Rhi then headed to Maryport for tea and I went on a fruitless petrol station hunt, eventually finding one 40 miles later at Ambleside.\n\n\n\n\n",

Even the Halton Rapids demon Eva didn’t want to get off the sofa this morning.\nA crew of Gibbi, Paul, Alec, Rachael, Amy, Eva, Emma, Arne, Jenny, Darren, Simon and Dale assembled at the hut and we decided to head to Waterhead and try and sneak up some of the Rothay and Brathay with Dean meeting us there. Driving up to Ambleside, the sun did start to peak out from behind the clouds, and we were surprised to arrive and find Waterside Carpark partially underwater! Definitely lots of rain around.\nWe paddled from Waterhead pier, past the Brathay Hall boathouse to Brathay Bay, before turning back and up to the confluence of the Rothay and the Brathay. We spent some time near the cottage practising ferry gliding and eddy hopping.\nAlec took Darren, Arne and Simon to run the Clappersgate section, whilst the rest of us practised our ferry gliding and break ins. Eva was determined to paddle up the Brathay a little higher, and succeeded in powering up a fast moving section and a play wave, shortly followed by Dale (not to be out done!). The rest of us modestly decided to watch on from below.\nA great first taste of moving water for Dean, Emma and Jenny, and Simon’s first river paddle in a white water boat. Arne also got to try out his shiny new boat and paddle, and Paul was strutting his stuff in a new fluorescent orange dry suit! Great to be out and about again :)\n\n\n\n",

I was helping as an assistant leader with Mike Sunderland taking two family groups out around Piel.\nWe got on the water at 10:30 from the Boat Club. We did some skills in the channel, feeling the effect of the current and practising turns around the buoys. We paddled under the RNLI Lifeboat station, and paddled along though the boats before crossing to Piel island. We had lunch by the castle, and then crossed over to Walney. We tried to practice bow rudders, but the seals had other plans! They were very inquisitive and kept popping up behind us. We went around to the southern tip of Walney to the seal colony, keeping our distance. We paddled back to Roa Island, crossing the shipping channel. The sun came out in time for drinks at the RIBC bar.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, the weather was overcast, and the winds were higher, meaning we had less shelter to practice skills. After getting the paddlers in our group to switch boats, we paddled across directly to Piel castle. As the youngest paddler was getting tired, we headed back directly to Roa Island.\nI really enjoyed the opportunity to assist leading a group over two days. On the first day I was enjoying helping Annika with her handling skills. It was interesting to see how giving her a better set of paddles helped her paddling. On the second day I spent more time with her younger brother Henry, trying to keep him motivated when he got tired.\n\n\n\n",

Having a base at the bunkhouse on Muck was excellent - it gave us the opportunity to really get to know the coast of the island under different conditions and enjoy the hospitality of the local community. One of the satisfying things about having a development week was seeing the improvements across the group in the week. Swell that felt lumpy to paddle on day one became a spot for practising rolls and rescues, rock hopping gaps which felt a tight squeeze seemed to get bigger through the week and anxieties of open water crossings transformed into a quiet confidence. Personal highlights for me were our camping spot on the Isle of Eigg circumnavigation, watching a pair of Scottish eagles play in the wind and taking the local kids of Muck out for an evening paddle.

After lunch on the bay, we headed towards Football Hole before turning back North. We stopped at Beadnell Bay again for hot drink, but paddling through the surf I had a swim.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, we attempted the crossing to the Farnes. It was very misty and there were tourist boats out so we radioed the harbour master to let them know about our crossing. It was fairly choppy on the paddle over and we were paddling on a bearing. It was a relief to see the Inner Farnes appear out from the mist. Paddling around the Farnes, we were able to get pretty close up to the cormorants and puffins. We didn’t stay too long as the weather was due to change for the worse in the afternoon. The paddle back to the mainland was much quicker, due to the tides and a following wind. Again it was really misty and it was quite spooky to suddenly hear voices and see the beach emerge from the mist. We had a damp lunch on Bamburgh Bay, although it was so misty we couldn’t see the castle! Before getting off the water at Seahouses, we practiced playing the surf and bongo sliding.\n\n\n\n",

Various splits to accommodate for all paddling on general direction towards Happy Mount Park against the chop and wind. Snacks in Bare paddling pool then out into the very fast outgoing tide allows us to quickly get to the lifeboat station bay then back to start point at the Town Hall side slip. Nice waves, some surfing and heavy going to finish. Sunny throughout. Certainly a tougher proposition than planned but all were up to the exciting conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We were on the water for around 4 hours, working toward the white water award. The group doing the WWA were myself, Arne, Paul Jackson, Simon Murby and Adam, led by Paul Simpson & Dave Horn. This time we focused less on group skills and features and more on skills. We spent lots of time ferry gliding (forwards and backwards) and practising braces.\n\n\n\nI had one swim coming past the final baffle, I tried to high brace on a wave, missed and capsized. Not the best swim as I hit myself in the face with the paddle giving my self a nose bleed and got jammed on the shallow slabs by my boat and had to let it go down river. In hindsight I could have probably pushed myself back upright off the bottom and saved myself a swim. Aside from that it was a great day, with 2 other LDCC groups out.\nA good reminder that I definitely need more low and high brace practice - something for Thursday nights on the flat water.\n\n\n\n",

This time I had a swim, getting out at the big eddy before the first groyne. Ian rescued me and later led me through the rapids. After lunch we had a second run.

The forecast looked grim on paper but we seemed sheltered from the wind and except for one very heavy shower it wasn’t too bad at all. There was the usual efficient getaway to Halton. Busy for parking again. 2 ladies made it know to me that they found it difficult to park to walk their dog. The University Rowing Club were also present and this made it congested on their slipway.Amazing how long their craft are. It was a good chance for a bit of PR with them firstly over the trailer in the car park and then over possible parking down the back of the station. The former will be moved when they can get a vehicle to do it and the latter parking will not be possible because access it via an area they will be using to prepare craft for launch. Also looked at other launch/egress points away from their slipway for future days. 4 groups then below the weir for a warm-up and skills session before one group headed off towards the rapids until virtually all were up there in and around the cyclepath side of the islands making the best use of what was available. Great to see how people have come on over the last 5 weeks and lots of paddling against the current has made them stronger. It had been decided to just have one longer session. Groups slowly made their way back downstream to exit river left on the weir baffle. We certainly got in a good 2 plus hours of paddling in and everyone seemed well satisfied. We are likely to move the event to Sunday 1st November to make use of the whole river, as the fishing season ends, UNLESS the river level for that day is predicted to be way too high compared to the Saturday. We will approach the rapids from the lower weir. After that we will re-assess all our options. As mentioned in a previous post competent members can go and paddle the rapids in their own time from 1st November and approach from the Halton Mills site. I will post the Covid guidelines in the next couple of days. Members who have not been out with us recently and would like coach support should post their request later in the week. Another group of paddlers who arrived at the rapids today were amazed when I told them we were all from one Club…..LDCC. Long may we continue this level of support! Thanks to the lead figures today and of course Darren with van making kayak transport so much easier. Gibbi\n\n\n\n",

Some parking problems as it was a much nicer day. May solve that for next week. 3 groups led by Simon,Paul B and Colin with Gibbi and Paul J mingled among them. Much lower water level therefore we could get closer to the weir. Basic skills,river techniques a chance to go up towards the rapids and to run the weir. Much variety punctuated by a short lunch stop,a couple of soakings but a happy bunch were clear of the hut by 2.40pm and it had all gone rather well. Transport unshared and 2 daughters of non-paddling mums dropped at and picked up from the venue. Also could to see multi-activity use of the site what with the Fire Brigade practising rescue skills and 6 female paddle boarders/open water swimmers. Fishermen not to be seen🙂 Same time and place next week with some rain to come this week.\n\n\n\n",

It took an hour of so to load the boats up as it was our first time kayak camping and people had brought lots of stuff! There was a stong westerly wind, so we paddled west into the wind first, before turning around and making the most of the following sea. We stopped at Mossyard beach for a quick lunch, before turning into Fleet bay. We crossed the bay at a narrow point, and then followed the coast heading towards the island. It got quite choppy with big swell, which I enjoyed, however Elspeth was quite scared and was shouting swears as apparently she gets angry when she gets scared! We landed on the island, unpacked and started setting up camp. I went for a walk whilst the boys catch some fish. We had a bonfire on the beach, cooking sea bass on the fire, mussels, stick bread and apple crumble parcels (complete with forged blackberries!) A fantastic evening, and an incredible dark sky.\n\n\n\nWe packed up quickly the next morning and were on the water for 09:30. WIth the sun shining we were warm in our kayaking gear, but rounding the island the cold wind was biting. We circumnavigated the Barlocco isle, rock hopping and spotting a seal. The crossing from Barlocco to Ardwall was choppy with white horses and strong winds. From Ardwall, we crossed to the mainland, and then headed directly across the bay to Mossyard. We stopped for lunch, and Gina had a little nap as she was suffereing from the night before. Alan and I headed off direct to Auchenlarie, whilst the rest of the group played in the rocks on the final strech. A fabulous weekend and new friends made.\n\n\n\n",

People arrived well spaced to get gear and it was mostly quickly loaded in Darren’s van. Meant lots of cars headed for the old station car park but all managed to park,get their kit on,unload boats and get them down onto the big ramp in their 3 groups of 6. One group started on the flat water while the other 2 made their way onto the moving water below the weir. Had to keep well away from the weir as it was higher than the time before but plenty to play on. The slightly more experienced eventually looked after themselves,Amy and Eva joined Gibbi for their first taste of moving water and Eva proved to be AM-AZ-ING. Quick get-together at 12.15 and decision made to continue for another 45 mins or so Paul carried on with Kerry and Ruby who were finishing their beginners course (and it seems very much enjoyed their session),Colin and Anna took their group up to the bottom end of Halton Rapids (no fishermen). Some capsises but simply dealt with. Off the water and it went like clockwork to get back to the hut and put all gear away. Keep an eye on here for details of the next event. Note there are probably 5 people already on the list for that. Also there was some confusion finding the latest Thurs ev post on the LDCC page and I hope we can get that sorted. Always scroll the page to find very latest and then only reply to that one and do even look for updates at breakfast the day of paddling!\n\n\n\n",

We practised paddling out to South Head, into the winds, then looping back on ourselves. After a couple of loops, we turned south and paddled with a following sea. The paddle back up North into the wind was very hard. Eventually, we made it back to the slipway, and did a surf landing. Most of the group decided they had had enough for one day, and had a leisurely lunch. I had a lovely evening with Nic & Steve at their campervan.\n\n\n\nThankfully, the wind was lighter on Sunday, and we headed North. We stopped at Fleswick Bay for a coffee & snack. I saw a seal (possibly the Fleswick bay seal). We started heading towards Whitehaven but some of the group were struggling with the speed, so we stopped for lunch on the rocks at Saltom Bay. We slowly and gently paddled back to St Bees slipway, and popped to Hartley’s for tea.\n\n\n\n",

I passed a small group attempting to paddle the gap between Lingy Holm. Past Silver bay, and then a long strech along Birk Fell, which I used to practice efficient, fast forward paddling. I stopped for lunch near Howtown, after doing a bit of litter picking. On the paddle back south, I stopped at Norfolk Island for a hot drink and to look at the view. The southerly wind had picked up a little, making progress a little slower. I did two loops through Lingy Holm gap, and looped around Wall Holm before landing back near the ferry pier. An excellent first adventure - next stop a solo sea paddle!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We paddled up to the lower weir at Halton, Gibbi telling us about the Lune as we paddles. At Halton, we played in the tongue of water coming off the weir, practicing ferry gliding. We ate lunch on the battlement, and used the portage as an excuse to run down the middle of the weir. I forgot to smile - very dangerous. After lunch we kept playing in the flow, doing S-turns and ferries. Paul cycled up to have a chat. We paddled back down to the clubhouse, using our paddles as sails and making the most of the northerly winds. Gibbi: Colin and myself combined our groups into a six with Michelle, Alice, Richard and Rhi. A fine, warm day with a breeze blowing downstream and therefore into our faces as we casually paddled up to the lower weir at Halton. A short play in the moving water before taking lunch on the baffle. Sliding into the water upstream of the weir and paddling down through the tongue was achieved without incident followed by an hour of gentle skills practice in the moving water as can be seen in the pics. Well done all. Colin and I were quite impressed with your enthusiasm and progress. With the wind behind us it was a tiring paddle back to the hut. All now wearing spraydecks confidently after passing capsize tests. Another group with Paul, 3 youngsters and Wendy did the same trip\n\n\n\n",

We then turned around and paddled with a following sea towards Fleswick Bay. Before stopping for lunch we practiced eskimo and X rescues. After lunch we had a leisurely paddle alongside the South head, spotting lots of cormorants and porpoises.

No chance for a warm we set off into swift moving water. We worked as 2 pairs and got loads of breaking out/in practice. Still plenty of large enough eddies for the 4 of us . The higher level meant very few stones to impede our progress. It was good to see our 1st year paddlers getting stuck into consolidating their skills and gaining much more benefit than another Halton rapid session. Not wanting to spoil the day we got off before the Wennigton Bridge surf wave. The swift water meant we were off, dressed, shuttle done, quite quickly so we called in at the Tatham Bridge imbibing emporium . Highly recommended. Thanks for a great day gang.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Despite the forecast for strong winds and rain we were lucky to get 2 runs down with only an occasional gust and a bit of drizzle at the end. Apart from a couple of lady paddlers from the Ribble club, we had the river to ourselves. Pushing our techniques on the usual manoevers and throwing in a little boofing practice as well.

After some considerable parking faff (and an excellent exhibition of how to reverse a van back along a country lane by Simon) we put on at Rydal water. The river was on a low but there were plenty of eddys for people to make the river as simple or challenging as they wished and some great opportunities to practice ferry glides. A Weir provided a great (but slightly grabby) surfing spot for people to try the skills and Gibbi to take some photos of the action.\n\n\n\nThe next wave we came across offered more fun…until King of the Wave ended in both Steve and Simon high bracing for survival as they were washed off the wave. Steve was successful in saving himself from a capsize whereas Simon wasn’t. He quickly rolled in the chilly water and then had a mini sulk that he’d gotten his hair wet. Joe successfully hand paddled onto the wave and styled it for a few minutes until his hands became too cold! We finished the journey at the Rugby Club in Ambleside. Alan provided us with some much appreciated and very festive Christmas Cake whilst we checked on River levels to see if a cheeky run of the Brathay was possible. After deciding it was a smidge too low, we finished the day in Hawkshead Brewery (much to many people’s delight!) A successful day with no swims and great company.

A good paddle was needed and we got 1. Lots of water about, but given the crew, strong winds and poor light levels we opted for the River Kent from Burnside through Kendal to Scroggs Weir. It was on the low end of a mid level. Paddlers:- Paul, Dave, Simon, Darren, Rhi, Paul, special guest appearance from Alex Hill. And an eventual appearance of Alan and Steve. (I think they have problems with Dysania). After the shuttle, we all worked on our efficient ferry gliding skills, forwards and in reverse. The overcast but dry and calm start made progress easy as we worked on grabbing eddies, playing follow my leader.\n\n\n\nPaul over-egged a breakout, propping myself upright with paddle, but got a kindly nudge from Alex to get me level again. A sheep trapped on the riverbank was not for being helped. We pressed on to the big weir in Kendal which was well covered by Simon and Alex on the side. Everybody got over fine. Lots of surfing to be had on the town features. People dialled into their own level of fun, sometimes with persuasion. Just a couple of swims today, each as a result of side surfing. The wind picked up and was cutting. Whilst getting changed there was a good flurry of ice crystal precipitation, (not to be confused with hail, a summer phenomenae, thanks Dave for the clarification). Thank you to the cake produced by Alan or Steve to liven up the change into dry gear. Thank you everyone for another good spirited club outing.\nI had one swim after accidentally side surfing, whilst paddling through the middle of Kendal. I got pretty cold on the last section paddling to Scroggs Weir.\n\n\n\n",

Halton was on a (high) low so we headed over to the Mill and were later joined by Alan and Steve. We played at the top for a while, practising sweep strokes until we were dizzy and then slowly picked our way down the river. Around midday the sun was just starting to peek over the trees and provided some welcome warm sunshine. Beckie and Simon also popped down for a chat and some advice from the bank. We only did one run today, but still had a good three hours of play and practice. Skills practised included Paul’s elusive “electric ferry glide” ( you’ll have to ask him…) Another great day on the river and we’ve definitely earned our dinner and pints tonight.\n\n\n\n",

Tom helping Anna ease back into her stride and coaching Darren. The rest of us worked our way down from the top in pairs, making the most of what was there, reading the flow for the best lines and improving skills. Keep up the good work Rhi and Darren. We got 2 good runs down with only a few others on the water. Got off at about 1.00, just in tme for lunch and another opportunity to sample Alans fresh batch of Ginger nuts.\n\n\n\n",

Joe,Rowan and Thomas Ellison went off to do the Leven and then the Lower Kent but Thomas B left Halton during our lunch stop to join them for the Kent. A good 2 hour session from the top to start and lots of skills stuff. Small other group of kayakers. Surprised as a van,mini bus and car drove up to the hydro plant….turns out they were W Yorks Fire and Rescue and come to Halton for clean water to swim in. No clean rivers in Yorkshire? Well certainly not in some areas at the moment. Turns out they have had an arrangement with the hydro people for over a year and have the code for the gate!! Lunch taken in the warmth of the changing area with some lovely cake from Alan. Always worth paddling with him. Then a further 90 mins session. I think we were all pleasantly tired and ready to finish.\n\n\n\n",

We headed to the Leven which was on a low. As newbies, Darren and I weren’t up to the whole Leven, so we got in near Newby Bridge below the graveyard with Gibbi and Paul to do some skills work. The rest of the group got in higher up to run the more adventurous section. We practised ferry gliding, s-turns and eddying out.\n\n\n\nThere were number of paddlers out, including Liverpool canoe club, and a group of open whitewater canoes. After a bit of lunch we portaged back up-river to run the section again, this time picking our own way though the rocks and into eddys. We carried on to Backbarrow, getting out just before Backbarrow bridge. I was quite glad we weren’t running that, although I’m sure the more advanced group enjoyed it. We caught up with the others at the Cafe Ambio car park. Turns out whilst we’d been working hard, they’d been having a leisurely cuppa! It was great to have the opportunity to practise skills with Paul and Gibbi, even though my brain hurts a bit now! Thanks for a great day paddling.\n\n\n\n",

Could write an essay on it but best to be brief and to the point. Most people travelled down at various times during Friday but those who could get there by the afternoon took the opportunity to walk or mtn bike. By late evening fortunately most had managed the tricky navigation there and dug into Anna’s pre-prepared chilli meal. After helpings of Paul’s porridge groups broke off to paddle the Tryweryn; walk along the river via Swallow Falls; stroll in Betws and partake of food; the largest group, to MTN bike in the forest with a mix of itineraries to suit all levels, some hiring bikes/first timers/an e-bike and of course the experts. Back to BYG for a brew and shower and a meal in the pub in village.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, after cleaning the Centre, a small group on the Dee at Llangollen, but main group on a very pleasant paddle from near Betws to Llanrwst on the Conwy meeting up with locally residing Annette. Also, a couple of strollers. Then it was home. So, there was something for everyone to do . Fine accommodation, pretty good weather and great company. Thanks to Dave Horn for organising it all. Many have already expressed their gratitude elsewhere and told of their enjoyment of the weekend.\n\n\n\n",

After the recent deluge, the levels had dropped overnight and the upper upper Lune was chosen as our playground. On the drive up to the Tebay start, there was more blue sky showing than was forecast. After the shuttle, we all got onto the swift flowing water breaking the journey up by regrouping in eddies or for the occasional re-seating of a swimmer. With such so much sunshine, warmth and wind free, it was hard to believe this is our first winter journey of the year.\n\n\n\nIt was great to see everyone working hard on their breaking in / out, and paddling control skills. Getting out at Low Gill was made a little more difficult by picking our way through the fencing erected to enable works to be done on the bridge. This work is scheduled to last 8 weeks but not date was given. Thanks to everyone for making a good day great.\n\n\n\n",

Parking up at the old railway station, everyone geared up and braced themselves for a good 10min trek carrying the kayaks to the top of the wier along the cycle track, where we would begin our fun. Following David horns lead with help from Paul, Alec and Joe the beginners took to the water consisting of myself, Darren, kamikaze Gregg, Rhian, Kim, Mandy and steve (sorry if I’ve missed anyone). The first task was to see how far up we could paddle up a fast flowing section of water, Alec demonstrating how it was done comfortably. Everyone got stuck in with steve winning this particular challenge but everyone looked more confident with every attempt. We then headed down stream, occasionally getting stuck on the odd rock as the water levels were low. We practised picking a line through the Rapids and eddying out, everyone managing to do this well until on one section the water tipped my kayak. No problem though as I completed my first ever roll (ok I may of cheated and used an underwater rock to flip me back round but I’m claiming it). The water started to become a little more stronger which certainly got my adrenaline going along with my enjoyment. It was then on the next eddy where I think I was a little too eager to break out and ended up going for the only swim of the day, this is where the pool sessions came in handy and I calmly got to safety and reset myself for the next section. Further down we practiced ferry gliding/riding a wave. Something I’m certainly becoming more confident in doing after having a couple of opportunities to practise in the past. Darren was certainly enjoying his improvements and added confidence; every time returning with a gleeming smile. We then finished the day off by paddling down the middle of the lower wier and paddling across the strong flow a few times. It was a nice hot sunny day, enjoyed by all. Now time for a rest and a deserved beer or two, fingers cross for a week of rain.\n\n\n\n",

We met at the hut at 9am sharp as per instructions given at the talk on Thursday evening. A select band including Rhian, Lucas, Darren, Steve, Joe, Rowan, Ruby and I, ably led by Paul. Some of us not knowing quite what to expect from the winter paddling season save from it’s better than staying in and watching Coronation street and that at some stage it’s going to get proper cold. But not today though, the weather was settled as the remanents of hurricane Dorian had moved away to the north to be replaced by high pressure and settled conditions. Dorain had not filled up the rivers much though. With the water levels on the high side of low Paul suggested our options were limited to coming down the Lune on the incoming tide or playing at Halton. We decided on the later and to warm we up we would paddle there from the hut up to Halton weir. We set off upstream towards Halton just before 10am pushed along by a pleasing tail wind. We hugged river left dodging the many scullers on the river that morning. At the weir Paul tasked us with ferry gliding across the moving water from one bank to the next, only to abandon this plan when we beached in the middle of the river, the river having inconsiderately deposited a load of stones and rocks right in our path over recent weeks. Plan B was to hop over the weir and to paddle a little further upstream to practice moving water skills at the bottom of Halton rapids. At the bottom of the rapids and watched over by a sinister looking stuffed badger we got to grips with ferry gliding across the flow, breaking in and out, spotting Eddys and holding position in the flow before moving a little further up the river to fine tune on faster moving water. Steve showed us the hidden dangers of surfing when he was unexpectedly turned over by a submerged rock only to roll up in impressive fashion. Joe and Rowan demonstrated what can be achieved in a year of paddling with their stylish play boating skills. Rhian, Lucas, Darren, Ruby and I grew in confidence as the day wore on. There was only one swimmer on the day and in my defence I went over on purpose to a) test my dry suit out and b) to show Ruby how to come out of your boat in moving water and not because c) I forgot to the mantra “paddle, paddle, paddle” at a crucial moment. We paddled home about 3 but not before Paul showed us how to hug some rocks. The pleasing tail wind was now a less than pleasing head wind but the scullers had gone home at least. The head wind made the trip back a challenge to tired muscles but the sunlight playing on the water lifted the spirits. What a great day! I can think of few better ways to spend a Saturday. Thanks to Paul for his tutelage and to Rhian, Darren, Rowan, Joe, Lucas, Steve and Ruby for great company. I learnt loads not least that the best place to play a didgeridoo is under the motorway bridge! Looking forward to the next trip.\n\n\n\n",
