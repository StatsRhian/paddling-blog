I was helping as an assistant leader with Mike Sunderland taking two family groups out around Piel.\nWe got on the water at 10:30 from the Boat Club. We did some skills in the channel, feeling the effect of the current and practising turns around the buoys. We paddled under the RNLI Lifeboat station, and paddled along though the boats before crossing to Piel island. We had lunch by the castle, and then crossed over to Walney. We tried to practice bow rudders, but the seals had other plans! They were very inquisitive and kept popping up behind us. We went around to the southern tip of Walney to the seal colony, keeping our distance. We paddled back to Roa Island, crossing the shipping channel. The sun came out in time for drinks at the RIBC bar.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, the weather was overcast, and the winds were higher, meaning we had less shelter to practice skills. After getting the paddlers in our group to switch boats, we paddled across directly to Piel castle. As the youngest paddler was getting tired, we headed back directly to Roa Island.\nI really enjoyed the opportunity to assist leading a group over two days. On the first day I was enjoying helping Annika with her handling skills. It was interesting to see how giving her a better set of paddles helped her paddling. On the second day I spent more time with her younger brother Henry, trying to keep him motivated when he got tired.\n\n\n\n",

Having a base at the bunkhouse on Muck was excellent - it gave us the opportunity to really get to know the coast of the island under different conditions and enjoy the hospitality of the local community. One of the satisfying things about having a development week was seeing the improvements across the group in the week. Swell that felt lumpy to paddle on day one became a spot for practising rolls and rescues, rock hopping gaps which felt a tight squeeze seemed to get bigger through the week and anxieties of open water crossings transformed into a quiet confidence. Personal highlights for me were our camping spot on the Isle of Eigg circumnavigation, watching a pair of Scottish eagles play in the wind and taking the local kids of Muck out for an evening paddle. A massive thanks to Mike, Mac, Mike and Marie for their coaching and support and all the other paddlers for their lovely company! Photos: https://photos.app.goo.gl/GfPnkH3AVtdowE5g6\n\n\n\n",

We were hoping to make it out to the Farne Isles, but the weather was not looking promising.\nOn Saturday, we paddled from Seahouses and headed down the coast South towards Beadnell Bay. After lunch on the bay, we headed towards Football Hole before turning back North. We stopped at Beadnell Bay again for hot drink, but paddling through the surf I had a swim.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, we attempted the crossing to the Farnes. It was very misty and there were tourist boats out so we radioed the harbour master to let them know about our crossing. It was fairly choppy on the paddle over and we were paddling on a bearing. It was a relief to see the Inner Farnes appear out from the mist. Paddling around the Farnes, we were able to get pretty close up to the cormorants and puffins. We didn’t stay too long as the weather was due to change for the worse in the afternoon. The paddle back to the mainland was much quicker, due to the tides and a following wind. Again it was really misty and it was quite spooky to suddenly hear voices and see the beach emerge from the mist. We had a damp lunch on Bamburgh Bay, although it was so misty we couldn’t see the castle! Before getting off the water at Seahouses, we practiced playing the surf and bongo sliding.\n\n\n\n",

This time we focused less on group skills and features and more on skills. We spent lots of time ferry gliding (forwards and backwards) and practising braces.\n\n\n\nI had one swim coming past the final baffle, I tried to high brace on a wave, missed and capsized. Not the best swim as I hit myself in the face with the paddle giving my self a nose bleed and got jammed on the shallow slabs by my boat and had to let it go down river. In hindsight I could have probably pushed myself back upright off the bottom and saved myself a swim. Aside from that it was a great day, with 2 other LDCC groups out.\nA good reminder that I definitely need more low and high brace practice - something for Thursday nights on the flat water.\n\n\n\n",

We stopped at Mossyard beach for a quick lunch, before turning into Fleet bay. We crossed the bay at a narrow point, and then followed the coast heading towards the island. It got quite choppy with big swell, which I enjoyed, however Elspeth was quite scared and was shouting swears as apparently she gets angry when she gets scared! We landed on the island, unpacked and started setting up camp. I went for a walk whilst the boys catch some fish. We had a bonfire on the beach, cooking sea bass on the fire, mussels, stick bread and apple crumble parcels (complete with forged blackberries!) A fantastic evening, and an incredible dark sky.\n\n\n\nWe packed up quickly the next morning and were on the water for 09:30. WIth the sun shining we were warm in our kayaking gear, but rounding the island the cold wind was biting. We circumnavigated the Barlocco isle, rock hopping and spotting a seal. The crossing from Barlocco to Ardwall was choppy with white horses and strong winds. From Ardwall, we crossed to the mainland, and then headed directly across the bay to Mossyard. We stopped for lunch, and Gina had a little nap as she was suffereing from the night before. Alan and I headed off direct to Auchenlarie, whilst the rest of the group played in the rocks on the final strech. A fabulous weekend and new friends made.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nRiver Wenning\nPunchbowl to Wennington\nStrava\nSaturday 29th Feb report. (Scary day for dedicated single blokes !) Storm Joge set arrive today aswell. At the hut we split into 2 groups but both doing the Wenning. Colin Howard , Rhi, Darren and Paul got on at the Punch Bowl after asking permission to use the pub cark park ( Landlord is a kayaker too). The other larger group of paddlers get on was a few more miles upstream, their report to follow i’m sure. The river was on a half way up a mid. No chance for a warm we set off into swift moving water. We worked as 2 pairs and got loads of breaking out/in practice. Still plenty of large enough eddies for the 4 of us . The higher level meant very few stones to impede our progress. It was good to see our 1st year paddlers getting stuck into consolidating their skills and gaining much more benefit than another Halton rapid session. Not wanting to spoil the day we got off before the Wennigton Bridge surf wave. The swift water meant we were off, dressed, shuttle done, quite quickly so we called in at the Tatham Bridge imbibing emporium . Highly recommended. Thanks for a great day gang.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The group split up, with Paul, Darren, Alan, Steve and myself heading to the upper, upper Lune whilst the other group decided on the upper Lune. We got in below the grade 4 at Tebay (maybe next year… 😉) and warmed up with some ferry gliding. The river was on a low so the day was spent playing follow my leader and avoid the rock. I thought my river reading was improving a little until I planted myself on a rock and took a swim. Nature highlights included one lone black sheep and a pair of dippers playing. A little chilly but fulfilled we got out at Lowgill and stopped off to warm up at Longlands, Tewitfield. A lovely day to be out on the water, thanks all.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nStrava\nThe Rothay\nRydal to Ambleside\nA sizable group made up of Paul, Colin, Alan, Steve-o, Steve, Darren, Rhi, Joe, Thomas, Alec, Simon & I plus John as a bank based addition headed up to the Rothay. After some considerable parking faff (and an excellent exhibition of how to reverse a van back along a country lane by Simon) we put on at Rydal water. The river was on a low but there were plenty of eddys for people to make the river as simple or challenging as they wished and some great opportunities to practice ferry glides. A Weir provided a great (but slightly grabby) surfing spot for people to try the skills and Gibbi to take some photos of the action.\n\n\n\nThe next wave we came across offered more fun…until King of the Wave ended in both Steve and Simon high bracing for survival as they were washed off the wave. Steve was successful in saving himself from a capsize whereas Simon wasn’t. He quickly rolled in the chilly water and then had a mini sulk that he’d gotten his hair wet. Joe successfully hand paddled onto the wave and styled it for a few minutes until his hands became too cold! We finished the journey at the Rugby Club in Ambleside. Alan provided us with some much appreciated and very festive Christmas Cake whilst we checked on River levels to see if a cheeky run of the Brathay was possible. After deciding it was a smidge too low, we finished the day in Hawkshead Brewery (much to many people’s delight!) A successful day with no swims and great company. Merry Christmas and hopefully see everyone out next week🎄🥂\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nThe River Kent\nMiddle (Burnside - Scroggs)\nStrava\nPaddle Report for Saturday 14th Dec. Given the news yesterday, its no wonder some people develop Friggatriskaidecaphobia ! A good paddle was needed and we got 1. Lots of water about, but given the crew, strong winds and poor light levels we opted for the River Kent from Burnside through Kendal to Scroggs Weir. It was on the low end of a mid level. Paddlers:- Paul, Dave, Simon, Darren, Rhi, Paul, special guest appearance from Alex Hill. And an eventual appearance of Alan and Steve. (I think they have problems with Dysania). After the shuttle, we all worked on our efficient ferry gliding skills, forwards and in reverse. The overcast but dry and calm start made progress easy as we worked on grabbing eddies, playing follow my leader.\n\n\n\nPaul over-egged a breakout, propping myself upright with paddle, but got a kindly nudge from Alex to get me level again. A sheep trapped on the riverbank was not for being helped. We pressed on to the big weir in Kendal which was well covered by Simon and Alex on the side. Everybody got over fine. Lots of surfing to be had on the town features. People dialled into their own level of fun, sometimes with persuasion. Just a couple of swims today, each as a result of side surfing. The wind picked up and was cutting. Whilst getting changed there was a good flurry of ice crystal precipitation, (not to be confused with hail, a summer phenomenae, thanks Dave for the clarification). Thank you to the cake produced by Alan or Steve to liven up the change into dry gear. Thank you everyone for another good spirited club outing.\nI had one swim after accidentally side surfing, whilst paddling through the middle of Kendal. I got pretty cold on the last section paddling to Scroggs Weir.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nThe River Leven\nNewby Bridge to Backbarrow\nStrava\nPaddle report for 19th October. Paddlers included: Gibbi, Paul, Darren, Sam, Tom, Joe, Alan, Steve, Andy and me. We headed to the Leven which was on a low. As newbies, Darren and I weren’t up to the whole Leven, so we got in near Newby Bridge below the graveyard with Gibbi and Paul to do some skills work. The rest of the group got in higher up to run the more adventurous section. We practised ferry gliding, s-turns and eddying out.\n\n\n\nThere were number of paddlers out, including Liverpool canoe club, and a group of open whitewater canoes. After a bit of lunch we portaged back up-river to run the section again, this time picking our own way though the rocks and into eddys. We carried on to Backbarrow, getting out just before Backbarrow bridge. I was quite glad we weren’t running that, although I’m sure the more advanced group enjoyed it. We caught up with the others at the Cafe Ambio car park. Turns out whilst we’d been working hard, they’d been having a leisurely cuppa! It was great to have the opportunity to practise skills with Paul and Gibbi, even though my brain hurts a bit now! Thanks for a great day paddling.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nBetws to Llanrwst\nStrava\nWell you are probably going to see lots of pics of the excellent Club trip this last weekend. Could write an essay on it but best to be brief and to the point. Most people travelled down at various times during Friday but those who could get there by the afternoon took the opportunity to walk or mtn bike. By late evening fortunately most had managed the tricky navigation there and dug into Anna’s pre-prepared chilli meal. After helpings of Paul’s porridge groups broke off to paddle the Tryweryn; walk along the river via Swallow Falls; stroll in Betws and partake of food; the largest group, to MTN bike in the forest with a mix of itineraries to suit all levels, some hiring bikes/first timers/an e-bike and of course the experts. Back to BYG for a brew and shower and a meal in the pub in village.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, after cleaning the Centre, a small group on the Dee at Llangollen, but main group on a very pleasant paddle from near Betws to Llanrwst on the Conwy meeting up with locally residing Annette. Also, a couple of strollers. Then it was home. So, there was something for everyone to do . Fine accommodation, pretty good weather and great company. Thanks to Dave Horn for organising it all. Many have already expressed their gratitude elsewhere and told of their enjoyment of the weekend.\n\n\n\n",

After the recent deluge, the levels had dropped overnight and the upper upper Lune was chosen as our playground. On the drive up to the Tebay start, there was more blue sky showing than was forecast. After the shuttle, we all got onto the swift flowing water breaking the journey up by regrouping in eddies or for the occasional re-seating of a swimmer. With such so much sunshine, warmth and wind free, it was hard to believe this is our first winter journey of the year.\n\n\n\nIt was great to see everyone working hard on their breaking in / out, and paddling control skills. Getting out at Low Gill was made a little more difficult by picking our way through the fencing erected to enable works to be done on the bridge. This work is scheduled to last 8 weeks but not date was given. Thanks to everyone for making a good day great.\n\n\n\n",
