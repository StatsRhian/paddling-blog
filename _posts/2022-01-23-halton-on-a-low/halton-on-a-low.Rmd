A very low level today. We got on at the top. Sophie mentioned she was expecting more beginners and was hoping for an easier day. We paired up and I followed her around as she explored the top section. We inspected the first rapid, and then I set a line and she followed me down. I was a little nervous choosing a line for her, and being responsible for her but it worked really well. She wanted to skip the second set of rapids, so we scrambled over the baffle (and I fell on my bum). I then chased Dale's boat as he had a swim whilst playing in the middle of the final rapids. Unfortunately, he hit his head whilst trying to roll up and got a bump above his eyebrow. After lunch, Sophie and I stayed at the bottom, playing in the streams. We practised towing each other with a sling and ferry gliding with eyes closed. When Sophie was finally ready to get off the water, we drifted down to the steps and rescued a lost rubber duck.
